 ðŸ“ˆ Codec-Technology-Internship-Task-Stock-Price-Predictor  

Developed as part of the Codec Technology Internship, this project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical data.  
The model leverages Linear Regression and can be extended with advanced techniques such as LSTM networks.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of stock trends.  
Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras for efficient forecasting.  
Future scope includes integrating real-time data and building a web-based dashboard.
